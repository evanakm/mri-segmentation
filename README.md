Comparing two methods of segmenting tumours in MRI images

This repo was for a senior school project, comparing two very different methods of segmenting brain images to find a brain tumour.

The Chan-Vese algorithm is a global method based on an energy functional. Full details can be found at http://www.math.ucla.edu/~lvese/PAPERS/IEEEIP2001.pdf

It is compared to a region growing algorithm implemented in SimpleITK (http://www.simpleitk.org/).
